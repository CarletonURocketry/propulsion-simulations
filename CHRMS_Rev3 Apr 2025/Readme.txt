Installation & Setup
##################################################

Download The Whole CHRMS Folder and place it where you want your installation.

In order to run the CHRMS Simulator you need to have MATLAB version 2024b or newer and a compatible python version that can communicate with MATLAB.
To set this up please see: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-supported-python-implementation.html

Place the install folder wherevery you like. The simulator is self contained as long as you dont remove anything from it you will encounter no problems.
Note: if you move the installation folder the motor configs may not be able to find the fuel configs beause the saved location is different.

To run the program double click the app in the main installaion directory. 
The app should open alongside and instance of matlab.
Before you proceed the installation path needst to be added to the "PATH" varible. 
This can be done in MATLAB by navingting to the installation directory using the side bar rightclicking the installation folder and selecting: Add to Path > Selected Folders and Subfolders
Now the simulator should work.
