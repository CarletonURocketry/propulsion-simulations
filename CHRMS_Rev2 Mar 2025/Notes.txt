HEM model does initial search for P crit then only searches left of this point for subsequent steps
the subsequen steps search in increments of 20 pa I think but am not sure that this gaurentees finding P crit atleas if you are still at a saturated pressure

Dyer model curently uses injector inlet pressure = vapor pressure
if K deviates need to verify kow K varies cuz the original paper disagrees with the cited papers on which one gets what.

vent valve is an MV 74 listed CD of 0.6


waterloo has very high L/D 11.923 for injector to gaurentee HEM model and simplify mass flow calcs ours is 0.0075/0.0015 = 5

waterloo advises 3x feedline size vs injector area at all points cuz and slight pressure drop from flow will cause caviation.
current feed area = 0.00013273 m^2
current orifice area = 0.000106028 m^2
required feed dia = 0.02m = 0.79in

reason for huge pressure drop before boil of isss cux feed system adding large component of total volume that drop is just from liwuid jumping into the feed system before injector 

for cold flow 3.2 data is somwhat clean from 1 - 2.5 seconds

only reason ideal gas version of blowdonw works is cuz it is not checked via ideal gas law.I relize that his is atrotiously simplified and would throw it out if it didnt work so well.

martins method does not include a vpor phase

syncronized the output of the HRAP hijacked with CRAP. They now produce the same result and the debug section is in sim iteration rather than loop for HRAP hijacked beacuase it is an equivalent spot
HRAP
>Main
-Calcualtes ics 
-generates output object full of zeros
-assigns ic to output
	>Sim loop
	-creates i = 1 (varible used for assigning varibles to specific positions in the output full of zeros)
	-sets i = i + 1 so i = 2 now
		>Sim iteration
		-sets t to first step t = 0.001
		-does calcs
		-debug 
		-assigns new values to output at postiion i (this results in the inintial stuff being preserved at postition 1 and the new stuff goes into 2)

CRAP
>Main
-cals ic
-generates state and sets ics to state **including t = 0**
	>sim loop
	-generates output object and asigns initial conditions
	-calcs
	-iterates time
	-end conditions
	-makes output += output so that ic is preserved in first pos and does this every loop

There is a problem with greater >= operator. floating point bulshit can cause problem not sure if this is an issue anywhere other than the debug section.

with respect to the intermediate phase in the orginial HRAP tank model.
-in the nitrous tank emptying document it only says that this "can trigger engine bunout" and makes no reccomendations on how to handle the state between when the model goes wrong and the vapor phase
-in the HRAP theory of operation it decribes this phase as using a constant dT however, in the actual program it uses a constant dP.
-in og HRAP within the second phase delta p is calcualted by subtracting p_tank from the equation of state vapor pressure. However, the equation of state vapor pressure has not been updated with the 
new temperatue like it has in the first phase. this means that the pressure has not changed yet and hence delta p becomes zero for every loop while in the second phase. These zeros get added to the 
dp average in subsequent iterations which means the dp average skews towards zero. It seems lcear that this was not the intended functionality beacuse the first phase updates the vapor pressure
state first and the lines are simple swapped here. the theory of operation doc does not say that the average should start including zeros. its likley that its effect was small enoug that it was overlooked.
